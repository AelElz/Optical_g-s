/*
 * Kept apart from the provider for the same reason RouterContext is: Fast
 * Refresh only tracks a module when everything it exports is a component, so
 * a hook living beside LocaleProvider would break hot reload for every
 * consumer.
 *
 * It is also what keeps content/index.js and lib/locale.jsx from forming a
 * cycle. The provider reads the dictionaries to set the document title; the
 * content module reads the locale to pick one. Both import this, and this
 * imports neither.
